            <p>I just want to apologize for my actions last night. I really didn't mean to frustrate you. My emotions got the better of me, and I'm sorry that our day ended on a bad note. I hope you can forgive me, but I understand if you need time. I truly regret what happened and want to make things right between us.</p>
